# Einfuhlung
This is a personal project that I started in late January.

Einfuhlung is a site for strangers to anonymously post and respond to others. Unlike forums however, responses are absolutely private and will only  be seen by the poster. Responses will trigger a private conversation between strangers, who may elect to remove their anonymity eventually. The purpose is to offer people an outlet to share personal stories that they may not be comfortable sharing with people they know. It also allows strangers a place to offer encouragement/compliments, or to simply relate to others whom they may never talk to in normal life. It is a place where I hope friendships will develop and foster.

If you are interested in contributing to this project, please don't hesitate to let me know. It is currently on hiatus on my part, but I will eventually get back to it.
